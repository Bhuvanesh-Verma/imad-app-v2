   				The Math Explorers' Club is an NSF supported project that develops materials and activites to give middle school and high school students an experience of more advanced topics in mathematics. These materials are directed towards teachers, who are welcome to adapt and copy the materials in any way they see fit, as well as towards more advanced students, who may wish to learn independently.
